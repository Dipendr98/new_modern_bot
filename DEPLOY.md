## ðŸ” Troubleshooting

### Check Logs
In Railway dashboard â†’ Your service â†’ **"Deployments"** â†’ Click latest deployment â†’ **"View Logs"**
=======
## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Check Logs
In Railway dashboard → Your service → **"Deployments"** → Click latest deployment → **"View Logs"**
>>>>>>> f0e10c4ddeefca130962ae1ec2a89d1fe968e85b

Look for:
- `[ROUTER]` logs showing requests
- Any PHP errors
- Database connection issues

### Common Issues

**1. Connection closes immediately**
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify database credentials
- Check `/health` endpoint works

**2. Session issues**
- Ensure `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` is empty or not set
- Check `SESSION_SAMESITE` is set to `Lax`

**3. Database connection fails**
- Verify MySQL service is running
- Check `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS` variables
- Ensure database is in the same Railway project

**4. File uploads don't persist**
- Add a volume mounted at `/app/uploads`
- Check folder permissions
